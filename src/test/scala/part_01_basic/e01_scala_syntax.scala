/**
  * Introduction
  *
  * Scala is a JVM based language which promote functional programming style as well as object oriented programming style; and they play well together !
  * You can write Scala code very similar to Java one but itâ€™s not a really the best idea. We will see how to write good Scala code leveraging best parts of FP and OOP.
  * As a guide, if the code is immutable, there are chances it is not so bad ;)

/**
  * Side-note:
  * In Scala you can use `???` to express a missing piece of code.
  * It's just a shorthand for `throw new NotImplementedError("an implementation is missing")` which can replace any code and satisfy the compiler.
  * In this class we will use them a lot and you have to replace them to progress
